## Phase 1 — Action record path

### Unit outcome — `1-01-action-record-path.md`

Built the server action contract and fixture test; structural-only ingest; migration-backed projection state, normalized action rows, and deterministic conversation segments; independent retrying projection; bearer-scoped `/v1/actions`; and admin action counts plus their typed API field. Legacy conversation, hook-event, and facet results exclude `session_action` facts. Surfaces: `packages/yakka/internal/actions`, `internal/ingest`, `internal/store`, `internal/serve`, `packages/yakka-analytics/src/lib/api.ts`, and `docs/design/01-event-model-and-ingest.md`, `docs/design/03-remote-service.md`. Unit commit: `a32e3dc`; runner verification fix: `dc28c4d`.

Evidence from the unit report and runner verification:

- Baseline and final `cd packages/yakka && go test ./...` passed. The final run after the segment-boundary fix passed all packages; `cmd/yakka` took 61.962s.
- Targeted action-path, ingest, store, serve, retry, and API tests passed. In particular, fake-backed serve tests pass with scoring disabled, enabled, and unreachable; projection retries stop at three; a failed projection does not block screening; duplicate ingest is detected; invalid action values project as rejected; and the admin and legacy analytics checks pass.
- Runner verification found that later live rows lacked `segment_start`. The first new assertion failed; the projection now records each subsequent segment's start from its action timestamp. Focused `go test ./internal/store ./internal/serve -run 'Test(Action|SessionAction)' -count=1` and the full suite passed after the fix. Added checks also prove accepted live action over backfill and the latest review replacing the earlier review.
- `artifact_feedback`: the amended brief (version 2) and worker report are `delivered`, each `pass` by jev-1.13.0; no flagged checks.

Departure: the original brief listed `packages/yakka/docs/design/` paths, which do not exist; the corresponding server docs were updated under `docs/design/`. The brief was amended to name the actual paths and its second artifact feedback passed. No other departure. Worker report states no unfinished work. The runtime did not provide per-agent turn/final-context counts.

### Phase verification

Verified the phase outcome through `POST /v1/ingest` → asynchronous projection → bearer-scoped `GET /v1/actions` using the local fake-backed serve tests, and checked the returned normalized accepted/rejected rows and pending count. Store and serve tests prove duplicate handling, deterministic segments (including equal and out-of-order timestamps), source precedence, retry isolation, unchanged legacy analytics, and action status counts. The final full Go suite passed. No live classification, egress, or human review was performed or needed for Phase 1.

### Carried

- User-noted unrelated layout test failure: not reproduced by the baseline or final Go suite; not investigated. Preserve as a known external/unreproduced issue, and do not chase it in later Plan 22 phases unless it blocks their own checks.
- None of the implementation or test contracts needs amendment for the next refinement.
